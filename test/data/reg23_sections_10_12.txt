(10) Calculation of credit risk exposure: IRB approach (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 14)
Subject to the relevant provisions of regulation 38(2) and subregulation (20), a bank that wishes to adopt the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk-
    (a) shall obtain the prior written approval of the Registrar;
    Should the Registrar grant his/her approval, the bank shall in addition to the minimum requirements relating to the IRB approach specified in subregulation (11)(b) below, continuously comply with such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar;
    (b) shall calculate its exposure to credit risk, at the discretion of the bank, either in accordance with the provisions of Method 1, as set out in subregulations (11) and (12) below, or Method 2, as set out in subregulations (13) and (14) below, or, subject to such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar, a combination of the said methods.

(11) Method 1: Calculation of credit risk exposure in terms of the foundation IRB approach (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 14)
    (a) Unless specifically otherwise provided, a bank that obtained the prior written approval of the Registrar to adopt the foundation IRB approach to calculate the bank's exposure to credit risk in respect of positions held in the bank's banking book- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 14)
        (i) shall continuously comply with the relevant minimum requirements specified in paragraph (b) below and such further conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar in respect of any asset class subject to the IRB approach;
        (ii) shall continuously comply with the relevant minimum disclosure requirements specified in regulation 43(2);
        (iii) shall categorise its exposures in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (c) below;
        (iv) shall calculate its risk-weighted exposures in accordance with the relevant requirements and risk components specified in paragraph (d) below;
        (v) shall apply the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's securitisation or resecuritisation exposure, that is, a bank shall not use the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's securitisation or resecuritisation exposure unless the bank obtained the prior written approval of the Registrar to apply the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to underlying credit exposure, provided that the bank shall in respect of the said securitisation or resecuritisation exposures comply with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (b) (xii) below.
        (vi) shall calculate any relevant credit impairment, amongst other things, in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (22);
        (vii) shall deduct from the bank's capital and reserve funds, or risk weight such amounts, as may be specified in paragraph (q) below.
    (b) Minimum requirements (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 15)
        (i) Subject to such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar, a bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk in respect of positions held in the bank's banking book shall apply the said approach in respect of all the bank's material asset classes and business units.
        (ii) For a minimum period of three years or such lesser minimum period as may be specified in writing by the Registrar, prior to a bank's implementation of the foundation IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk, the rating and risk estimation systems and processes of the bank should have-
            (A) provided a meaningful assessment of borrower and transaction characteristics;
            (B) provided a meaningful differentiation of risk;
            (C) provided materially accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk;

        (iii) As a minimum, a bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk in respect of positions held in the bank's banking book shall have in place a duly documented credit policy, which credit policy-
            (A) shall be applied consistently over time for internal risk management purposes and in terms of the IRB approach;
            (B) shall in the case of exposures relating to corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks duly specify the relationship between borrower grades in terms of the level of risk that each grade implies, that is, the perceived and measured risk shall increase as the credit quality of an exposure declines from one grade to the next;
            (C) shall in the case of exposures relating to corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks duly specify the risk represented in each risk grade in terms of both a description of the probability of default risk typical for obligors assigned to the specific grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk;
            (D) shall be sufficiently robust to ensure that-
                (i) each relevant individual legal entity or person to which the bank is exposed is separately rated;
                (ii) the bank duly specifies the treatment of individual entities in a connected group, including the circumstances under which the same rating may or may not be assigned to all or some related entities;
                (iii) the bank develops and maintains a robust process for the identification of specific wrong way risk for each relevant person or legal entity to which the bank is exposed;

            (E) shall reinforce and foster the independence of the rating process;
            (F) shall duly specify the bank's process relating to the assignment of ratings to credit exposures;
            (G) shall duly specify the situations in which the senior management of the bank may override the output of the rating process, including how and to what extent such overrides may be used, and the names of senior management who may approve overrides of the modelobligor's output;
            (H)  shall contain comprehensive requirements to assess the creditworthiness of persons with overdraft facilities;
            (I) shall comprehensively deal with-
                (i) overdue amounts, including the manner in which the bank determines the number of past due days in respect of credit exposures;
                (ii) exposures that are in default;
                (iii) re-ageing of facilities or exposures, which re-aging, amongst other things, shall comprehensively deal with-
                    (aa) persons responsible for approval;
                    (bb) reporting requirements;
                    (cc) the minimum age of a facility or exposure before it is eligible for re-ageing;
                    (dd) the delinquency levels of facilities or exposures that are eligible for re-ageing;
                    (ee) the maximum number of exposures per facility, eligible for re-ageing;

                (iv) the granting of extensions, deferrals, renewals or rewrites in respect of existing accounts.
        (iv) A bank that uses multiple systems to support its assessment of credit risk- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 18)
            (A) shall duly document-
                (i) the rationale for assigning a particular obligor to a particular rating system;
                (ii) the specific industries or market segments to which a particular rating system applies;
            (B) shall allocate the bank's obligors to a rating system in a manner that best reflects the level of risk of a particular obligor.
        (v) Without derogating from the provisions of subparagraphs (i) to (iv) above, the rating and risk estimation systems and processes of a bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk in respect of positions held in the bank's banking book-
            (A) shall in the case of exposures to corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks, excluding any exposures relating to specialised lending that were mapped into the standardised rating categories specified in paragraph (d)(iii)(C) below, have separate and distinct dimensions relating to-
                (i) the risk of borrower default, that is, separate exposures to the same obligor shall be assigned to the same borrower grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction unless-
                    (aa) the one exposure is denominated in local currency whilst the other exposure is denominated in foreign currency; or
                    (bb) protection was obtained in the form of a guarantee, which protection resulted in an adjusted borrower grade,
                in which case separate exposures may result in multiple grades in respect of the same obligor.
                (ii) transaction-specific factors such as collateral, seniority and product type, provided that-
                    (aa) when the rating system of a bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach contains a facility dimension, which facility dimension reflects both borrower and transaction-specific factors, that is, the rating dimension reflects expected loss by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) and loss severity (LGD) considerations, the rating system shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this item (A);
                    (bb) a separate rating system that exclusively reflects LGD ratios shall be deemed to comply with the relevant requirements of this item (A);
                    (cc) when the rating dimension reflects expected loss but it does not separately quantify the LGD ratio in respect of the said exposure, the bank shall apply the LGD estimates determined by the Registrar.
            (B) shall in the case of exposures to corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks ensure a meaningful distribution of exposures across risk grades, that is, the bank shall not have excessive concentrations of exposure in any one of the bank's borrower rating or facility rating scales.
            As a minimum, a bank that adopted the IRB approach-
                (i) shall in the case of exposures other than specialised lending that were mapped into the standardised rating categories specified in paragraph (d)(iii)(C) below, have no less than seven borrower grades in respect of borrowers that are not in default and one grade for borrowers that have defaulted, provided that-
                    (aa) the bank shall in the case of concentrations within a single grade have empirical evidence that-
                        (i) the grades cover sufficiently narrow PD bands;
                        (ii) the default risk posed by borrowers in a particular grade falls within the specific band;
                    (bb) the Registrar may require a bank with a diverse portfolio of credit exposure to have more borrower grades than the minimum number of borrower grades specified in this sub-item (i);
                (ii) shall in the case of exposures relating to specialised lending, which exposures were mapped into the standardised rating categories specified in paragraph (d)(iii)(C) below, have no less than four borrower grades in respect of borrowers that are not in default and one grade for borrowers that have defaulted;
                (iii) shall assign a rating to each obligor and all eligible guarantors, which rating shall be reviewed or approved by a person who does not directly benefit from the extension of credit;
                (iv) shall associate each exposure with a facility rating as part of the loan approval process;
                (v) shall review assigned borrower and facility ratings on a regular basis, but not less frequently than once a year, provided that the bank shall review all relevant ratings as soon as material new information comes to the attention of the bank;
                (vi) shall have in place an effective process in order to obtain and update all relevant information;
            (C) may in the case of exposures relating to specialised lending, which exposures were mapped into the standardised rating categories specified in paragraph (d)(iii)(C) below, have a single rating dimension, which rating dimension reflects expected loss by incorporating both borrower strength, that is, PD, and loss severity, that is, LGD;
            (D) shall in the case of retail exposures- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 20)
                (i) be oriented towards and comprehensively capture-
                    (aa) borrower risk, which borrower risk shall include matters such as borrower type and demographics such as age or occupation; and
                    (bb) transaction risk, which transaction risk shall include matters relating to product and collateral types such as loan-to-value or lending-to-value measures, guarantees and seniority;
                    (cc) the delinquency status of all relevant exposures, that is, the bank shall separately identify exposures that are delinquent and exposures that are not delinquent;
                (ii) be sufficiently robust to ensure that the bank assigns each retail exposure to a relevant pool of retail exposures as part of the bank's loan approval process, which loan approval process shall make provision for-
                    (aa) a meaningful differentiation of risk, that is, there shall be a meaningful distribution of borrowers and exposures across the relevant retail pools of exposure in order to ensure that no single pool of exposures results in undue concentration in relation to the bank's total retail exposure;
                    (bb) a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures provided that the bank shall consider the risk drivers in respect of borrower risk, transaction risk and the delinquency status of retail exposures when the bank assigns a particular exposure to a particular retail pool of exposures;
                    (cc) accurate and consistent estimates of loss characteristics at a pool level, that is, for each pool of retail exposures, the bank shall estimate the risk components of PD, LGD and EAD, provided that the number of exposures in a particular exposure pool shall be sufficient to allow for a meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics at the pool level;
                    (dd) regular review, but not less frequently than once a year, of the status of individual borrowers within each pool and the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each relevant pool, provided that the bank-
                        (i) shall review all relevant risk characteristics as soon as material new information comes to the attention of the bank;
                        (ii) may make use of a representative sample to review the status of individual borrowers within each pool;
            (E) shall make provision for specific rating definitions and criteria in order to assign exposures to relevant risk grades, which definitions and criteria- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 22)
                (i) shall be plausible and intuitive in order to ensure a meaningful differentiation of risk;
                (ii) shall be sufficiently detailed to allow-
                    (aa) persons responsible for assigning of ratings to consistently assign borrowers or facilities that pose similar risk to the same grade;
                    (bb) third parties such as the internal audit department or an equally independent function, and the Registrar, to understand the assignment of ratings and to evaluate the appropriateness of the grade or pool assignments;
                (iii) shall be duly documented;
                (iv) shall be consistent with the bank's internal lending standards;
                (v) shall take into consideration all relevant and material information;
                (vi) shall periodically be reviewed in order to ensure that the definitions and criteria remain relevant and current.
            (F) shall incorporate an appropriate time horizon in order to assign a risk rating to a borrower, which rating shall be based on a sufficiently long time horizon-
                (i) to estimate an obligor's probability of default;
                (ii) to represent the borrower's ability and willingness to repay contractual obligations despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events;
            (G) shall be sufficiently robust to ensure that all relevant PD estimates of highly leveraged borrowers, or borrowers of which the assets consist predominantly of traded assets, reflect the performance of the relevant underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities;
            (H) may include statistical models and mechanical methods to assign borrower and facility ratings or estimate PD ratios, LGD ratios and EAD amounts, which models and methods-
                (i) shall take into account all relevant and material information;
                (ii) shall be used appropriately;
                (iii) shall have good predictive power;
                (iv) shall incorporate a reasonable set of risk predictors and the bank shall have in place clear guidelines and processes to monitor situations in which variables or risk inputs were altered;
                (v) shall be materially accurate across a range of borrowers or facilities;
                (vi) shall not contain any known material biases;
                (vii) shall be subject to a regular validation process of data inputs, including an assessment of accuracy, completeness and appropriateness;
                (viii) shall be subject to written policies and procedures for human review and judgement, provided that when human judgement is used to override the obligor's output, the bank shall separately keep track of the performance of the relevant exposure;
                (ix) shall be subject to regular backtesting.
            (I) shall be duly documented, which documentation, as a minimum- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 23)
                (i) shall address matters such as-
                    (aa) specific definitions of default and loss, which definitions shall materially be consistent with the definitions contained in this subregulation (11) and in regulation 67;
                    (bb) portfolio differentiation; 
                    (cc) rating criteria and the rationale for the bank's choice of particular internal rating criteria, provided that the bank shall be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Registrar that the selected rating criteria and procedures are likely to result in ratings that meaningfully differentiate risk;
                    (dd) the responsibilities of persons responsible for the rating of borrowers and facilities;
                    (ee) definitions relating to rating exceptions and the persons authorised to approve any rating exceptions;
                    (ff) the frequency of rating reviews;
                    (gg) management oversight and the bank's internal control structure;
                    (hh) the history of major changes in the bank's risk rating process;
                (ii) shall provide adequate evidence of the bank's compliance with all relevant minimum requirements;
                (iii) shall duly indicate any differences between the bank's risk estimates for purposes of complying with the IRB approach and for internal risk management purposes, such as pricing;
                (iv) shall in the case of statistical models used in the bank's rating process, comprehensively deal with-
                    (aa) the relevant methodologies, including a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions and/ or mathematical and empirical basis to assign risk estimate to risk grades, individual obligors, exposures or pools;
                    (bb) the data sources used;
                    (cc) the process to validate the model;
                    (dd) any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively.
            (J) shall be subject to appropriate independent review.
        (vi) Risk quantification (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 24)
            (A) Unless specifically otherwise provided, a bank shall in the case of exposures to corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks, estimate a PD ratio in respect of each internal borrower grade, which PD estimate-
                (i) may be based on one or more of the three techniques specified below, provided that the underlying historical observation period shall be a minimum period of five years in respect of at least one of the said techniques. 
                    (aa) Internal default experience
                    A bank-
                        (i) shall demonstrate that the PD estimates are based on the bank's underwriting standards and sufficiently reflect any differences between the rating system that generated the data and the bank's current rating system.
                        (ii) may use pooled data provided that the bank shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Registrar that the internal rating systems and criteria of the other banks in the pool are comparable with the bank's own internal rating systems and criteria.
                    (bb) Mapping to external data, that is, the bank may map its internal risk grades to a risk scale used by an eligible external credit assessment institution and then attribute the default rate observed in respect of the external credit assessment institution's grades to the bank's grades, provided that-
                        (i)  the bank shall compare and avoid any biases or inconsistencies between the bank's internal rating criteria and the criteria used by the external institution;
                        (ii) the bank shall compare and avoid any biases or inconsistencies between the internal and external ratings of any common borrowers;
                        (iii)  the external institution’s criteria underlying quantification shall be oriented to the risk of borrower default and shall not reflect transaction characteristics;
                        (iv) the bank shall compare and avoid any biases or inconsistencies between the definitions used in respect of default;
                        (v) the bank shall document the basis on which the mapping was done.
                    (cc) Statistical default models, that is, the bank may use a simple average of default-probability estimates in respect of individual borrowers assigned to a particular grade, which estimates were generated by statistical default prediction models, provided that the statistical model shall comply with the relevant minimum requirements specified in subparagraph (v)(G) above;
                (ii) shall be based on the definition of default, specified in regulation 67;
                (iii) shall be based on a population of exposures that closely matches or is at least comparable to the bank’s existing exposures and lending standards;
                (iv) shall be based on economic and market conditions that are relevant and current;
                (v) shall be a long-run average of the one-year default rates relating to the borrowers in a particular grade;
                (vi) shall incorporate all relevant and material information;
                (vii) shall take into account any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period;
                (viii) shall be reviewed on a regular basis but not less frequently than once a year or when material new information is obtained;
                (ix) shall be based on historical experience and empirical evidence;
                (x) shall be based on a sufficient number of exposures and data periods that will ensure accurate and robust PD estimates;
                (xi) shall be based on an estimation technique that performs well in out-of-sample tests;
            (B) Unless specifically otherwise provided, a bank shall in the case of retail exposures estimate a PD ratio and a LGD ratio in respect of each retail pool of exposures, which PD estimate and LGD estimate- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 27)
                (i) shall be based on the bank's internal data as the primary source of information;
                (ii) shall be based on a number of exposures in a particular exposure pool that is sufficient to allow for a meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics;
                (iii) shall be based on the definition of default, specified in regulation 67;
                (iv) may rely on external data or statistical models for quantification provided that the bank shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Registrar a strong link between-
                    (aa) the bank's process of assigning exposures to a particular pool and the process used by the external data source;
                    (bb) the bank's internal risk profile and the composition of the external data;
                (v) shall incorporate all relevant and material information;
                (vi) shall be based on a population of exposures that closely matches or is at least comparable to the bank's existing exposures and lending standards;
                (vii) shall be based on economic and market conditions that are relevant and current;
                (viii) shall be based on an estimation technique that performs well in out-of-sample tests;
                (ix) shall be reviewed on a regular basis but not less frequently than once a year or when material new information is obtained;
                (x) shall be based on long-run average estimates of PD and default-weighted average loss rates given default, based on an estimate of the expected long-run loss rate, provided that-
                    (aa) the bank may use an appropriate PD estimate to infer the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default;
                    (bb) the bank may use a long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default to infer the appropriate PD;
                    (cc) the LGD ratio used to calculate the bank's IRB capital requirement shall not be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default;
                (xi) shall, irrespective whether the bank is using external, internal, pooled data sources or a combination of the said three sources for the estimation of loss characteristics, be based on an underlying historical observation period of not less than five years, provided that the bank may with the prior written approval of the Registrar place more reliance on recent data when the said data better reflects loss rates in respect of the bank's retail exposures;
            (C) Based on the definition of default specified in regulation 67, a bank shall record all actual defaults in respect of all exposures subject to the IRB approach; (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 28)
            (D) When the status of a previously defaulted exposure subsequently changes, and as such no longer constitutes a defaulted exposure, the reporting bank shall rate the relevant obligor and estimate the relevant LGD ratio in a manner similar to a non-defaulted facility, provided that when the relevant exposure subsequently triggers one of the criteria relating to default, which criteria are specified in regulation 67, the relevant bank shall record a second default in respect of the said exposure;
            (E) As a minimum, a bank-
                (i) shall determine and specify a credit limit in respect of all authorised overdraft facilities, which credit limit-

            (A) Quantitative requirements  (#Heading)
            In order to calculate a bank's risk exposure relating to equity positions held in the bank's banking book in terms of the internal model market-based approach, the bank-
                (i) may use any type of value-at-risk (“VaR”) model, including models based on variance-covariance, historical simulation or Monte Carlo, provided that the model-
                    (aa) shall duly capture all material risks contained in the bank's equity positions, including general market risk and specific risk exposure;
                    (bb) shall be sufficiently robust to adequately explain historical price variation;
                    (cc) shall duly capture the magnitude of and changes in any concentration risk;
                    (dd) shall be robust to adverse market conditions;
                    (ee) shall be appropriate for the risk profile and complexity of the bank's equity positions, including positions in respect of non-linear instruments such as options;
                    (ff) shall have good predictive power and shall not produce materially incorrect capital requirements;
                    (gg) may with the prior written approval of the Registrar incorporate portfolio correlations into the bank's internal risk measures provided that the said correlations shall be based on empirical evidence and analysis;
                (ii) may use modelling techniques such as historical scenario analysis, provided that the said modelling technique shall produce a capital requirement equivalent to a potential loss based on a 99" percentile, one-tailed confidence interval of the difference between quarterly returns and the appropriate risk-free rate computed over a long-term sample period;
                (iii) may use single or multi-factor models, provided that- 
                    (aa) the risk factors-
                        (i) shall be sufficient to capture the risks inherent in the bank's equity portfolio;
                        (ii) shall correspond to the appropriate equity market characteristics in which the bank holds significant positions;
                    (bb) the bank shall demonstrate by way of empirical analyses, to the satisfaction of the Registrar, the appropriateness of the risk factors, including the risk factors’ ability to cover both general risk and specific risk;
                (iv) shall calculate estimated losses, which estimated losses-
                    (aa) shall be sufficiently robust to adverse market movements;
                    (bb) shall be relevant to the long-term risk profile of the bank's specific equity holdings;
                    (cc) shall incorporate all relevant and material data, information and methods;
                    (dd) shall be based on-
                        (i) realistic long-run experience, including a period of a reasonably severe decline in equity prices;
                        (ii) a number of risk exposures in the sample and a data period sufficient to provide the bank with confidence in respect of the accuracy and the robustness of its estimates;
                (v) shall use internal data and/or data from external sources, including pooled data, which data-
                    (aa) shall reflect the longest sample period for which data are available;
                    (bb) shall be meaningful in the sense that the data shall represent the risk profile of the bank's specific equity holdings;
                    (cc) shall be sufficient to provide conservative, statistically reliable and robust loss estimates;
                    (dd) shall be closely matched to or comparable with the bank's equity exposures;
                    (ee) shall be independently reviewed.
            (B) Qualitative requirements (#Heading)
            A bank that adopted the internal model market-based approach for the calculation of the bank's risk exposure in respect of equity instruments held in the bank's banking book shall comply with the relevant qualitative requirements specified in regulation 39(14) (a).
        (viii) Data maintenance (#Heading)
        As a minimum, a bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk shall collect and store data in respect of all key borrower and facility characteristics, which data-
            (A) shall provide effective support to the bank's internal credit risk measurement and management process;
            (B) shall be sufficiently detailed to allow retrospective re-allocation of obligors and facilities to the bank's various risk grades;
            (C) shall in the case of corporate, sovereign or bank exposures include-
                (i) the rating histories in respect of obligors and eligible guarantors;
                (ii) the date on which a rating was assigned;
                (iii) the methodology, key data and the model/person used to derive the rating;
                (iv) the identity of borrowers and facilities that defaulted, and the timing and circumstances of such defaults;
                (v) the PD ratios and realised default rates associated with the bank's rating grades;
                (vi) rating migration in order to keep track of the predictive power of the rating system;
            (D) shall in the case of retail exposures include-
                (i) the data that was used to allocate particular exposures to particular pools, including the data relating to borrower and transaction risk characteristics;
                (ii) the data in respect of delinquent exposures;
                (iii) data related to the estimated PD ratios, LGD ratios and EAD amounts associated with each relevant pool of exposures;
            (E) shall in the case of defaulted retail exposures include data in respect of the pool to which the exposure was assigned during the year preceding the default and the realised outcomes in respect of the LGD ratio and the EAD amount.
        (ix) Stress testing (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 35)
        As a minimum, a bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk shall have in place a stress-testing process in respect of the bank's exposure to credit risk, which stress testing process-
            (A) shall include an identification of possible events or future changes in economic conditions that may have an unfavourable effect on the bank's risk exposures and an assessment of the bank's ability to withstand such events or changes, which events or changes may include-
                (i) economic or industry downturns;
                (ii) market-risk events;
                (iii) liquidity constraints;
                (iv) mild recession scenarios;
            (B) shall in the case of protected exposure subject to the double default approach envisaged in subregulation (12)(g) include an assessment of the impact of-
                (i) a deterioration in the credit quality of protection providers, in particular the impact of protection providers falling outside the eligibility criteria specified in subregulation (12)(g) due to rating changes;
                (ii) the default of one but not both the obligor and the protection provider, and the consequent increase in risk exposure and the required amount of capital and reserve funds at the time of the said default;
            (C) shall be meaningful, based on the environment in which the bank conducts business;
            (D) shall assess the effect of a recession on the bank's PD ratios, LGD ratios and EAD amounts;
            (E) shall make provision for an internal ratings migration in respect of at least some of the bank's exposure to credit risk;
            (F) shall appropriately evaluate evidence of rating migration in respect of external ratings.
        (x) Validation of internal estimates (#Heading)
        As a minimum, a bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk-
            (A) shall have in place a robust system to validate the accuracy and consistency of the bank's rating systems and processes, including all estimates of relevant risk components, which internal assessments shall be based on long data histories, covering a range of economic conditions and ideally one or more complete business cycles;
            (B) shall regularly compare realised default rates with estimated PD ratios in respect of each grade and shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Registrar that the realised default rates are within the expected range for a particular grade;
            (C) shall duly document the data and the methods used to compare realised default rates with estimated PD ratios in respect of each grade, including the periods that were covered and any changes in the data and methods that were used, which analysis and documentation shall be updated at appropriate intervals, but not less frequently than once every year;
            (D) shall make use of quantitative validation tools and comparisons with relevant external data sources in order to validate the bank's internal estimates of risk components;
            (E) shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Registrar that the bank's quantitative testing methods and validation methods do not vary systematically with the economic cycle;
            (F) shall have in place sufficiently robust internal standards to deal with situations where realised PD ratios deviate substantially from expected PD ratios provided that when the realised values continue to be higher than expected values the bank shall adjust its estimates of risk components upward in order to reflect the appropriate default and loss experiences.
        (xi) Disclosure (#Heading)
        A bank that obtained the approval of the Registrar to adopt the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk shall disclose in its annual financial statements and other disclosures to the public sufficiently detailed qualitative and quantitative information in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in regulation 43(2).
        (xii) Securitisation and/or resecuritisation exposures (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 37)
        A bank that obtained the prior written approval of the Registrar to adopt the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk shall apply the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's securitisation or resecuritisation exposure, provided that-
            (A) the bank shall in addition to such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar comply with the relevant requirements specified in this subparagraph (xii) and the relevant requirements specified in paragraphs (e) to (p) below;
            (B) unless the Registrar determines otherwise, a bank that adopted the IRB approach in respect of some underlying exposures and the standardised approach in respect of the remainder of underlying credit exposures shall apply the approach that relates to the predominant part of underlying credit exposures in respect of the bank's exposure to a securitisation scheme or resecuritisation exposure;
            (C) when no specific IRB treatment is specified in respect of a particular underlying asset type, a bank that obtained the approval of the Registrar to adopt the IRB approach, which bank-
                (i) acts as an originator, shall apply the standardised approach specified in subregulation (6)(h) above to calculate the bank's capital requirement in respect of the relevant securitisation or resecuritisation exposure;
                (ii) does not act as an originator in respect of the securitised or resecuritised assets or exposures, but instead invests in an instrument issued in respect of the securitisation or resecuritisation scheme, shall apply the ratings-based approach specified in paragraph (e) below to calculate the bank's capital requirement in respect of the relevant securitisation or resecuritisation exposure.
            (D) when-
                (i) a securitisation or resecuritisation exposure is rated or a rating can be inferred as envisaged in paragraphs (e) and (f) below, the bank shall apply the ratings-based approach specified in
                paragraph (e) below to the relevant securitisation or resecuritisation exposure;
                (ii) an external or inferred rating is not available in respect of a securitisation or resecuritisation exposure, the bank shall apply the internal assessment approach or standard formula approach respectively specified in paragraphs (g) and (i) below, provided that the internal assessment approach shall be applied only to exposures that relate to an asset-backed commercial-paper programme, which exposures shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (g) below;
                (iii) the bank or another institution within the banking group of which such a bank is a member, acting as a servicing agent, a repackager, a sponsor in respect of a securitisation scheme other than an asset-backed commercial paper programme or a sponsor in respect of an asset-backed commercial paper programme provides a liquidity facility in respect of such a securitisation scheme, which liquidity facility complies with the relevant conditions specified in paragraph 7 of the exemption notice relating to securitisation schemes, the said bank or institution shall in the case of-
                    (aa) a rated liquidity facility apply-
                        (i) the ratings-based approach specified in paragraph (e) below;
                        (ii) a credit-conversion factor of 100 per cent to the relevant rated liquidity facility;
                    (bb) an unrated facility in respect of which an inferred rating is not available apply-
                        (i) the internal assessment approach specified in paragraph (g) below, provided that the bank shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) below, or
                        (ii) the standard formula approach specified in paragraph (i) below;
                    (cc) an eligible liquidity facility that may only be drawn in the event of a general market disruption apply a 100 per cent credit-conversion factor in terms of the ratings-based approach when the facility is externally rated;
                    (dd) a facility in respect of which neither the bottom-up approach nor the top-down approach can be applied to calculate the Kiags amount specified in paragraph (k) below, apply the highest risk weight assigned in terms of the standardised approach to any of the underlying individual exposures covered by the liquidity facility and a credit-conversion factor of 100 per cent;
                    (ee) all liquidity facilities other than the liquidity facilities envisaged above, assign to the relevant notional amount of the said liquidity facility a risk weight of 1250 per cent, or such imputed percentage that will effectively result in an amount equivalent to a deduction against capital and reserve funds,
                Provided that a bank that acts as an originator shall in no case provide any liquidity facility in respect of the securitisation scheme in respect of which that bank acts as such an originator.
                (iv) the bank or another institution within the banking group of which such a bank is a member, acting as a servicing agent, provides an eligible servicer cash advance facility in respect of a securitisation scheme, that is, a facility that, amongst other things, complies with the relevant conditions specified in paragraphs 7 and 9 of the exemption notice relating to securitisation schemes, the said bank or institution may in the case of any undrawn servicer cash advance facility that is unconditionally cancellable by the said bank or institution without prior notice, apply a credit-conversion factor of nil per cent in respect of the said undrawn facility, provided that-
                    (aa) the said facility shall duly state that the servicing agent is under no obligation to advance funds to investors or the special-purpose institution in terms of the servicer cash advance  facility;
                    (bb) any cash advance made by the servicing agent shall be at the servicing agent's sole discretion and solely to cover an unexpected temporary shortfall that arose from delayed payments;
                    (cc) the servicing agent's rights for reimbursement in terms of the said cash advance facility shall be senior to any other claim on cash flows arising from underlying exposures or collateral held in respect of the securitisation scheme;
                    (dd) a bank that acts as an originator shall in no case provide any servicer cash advance facility in respect of the securitisation scheme in respect of which that bank acts as such an originator.
                (v) none of the approaches specified in sub-items (i) or (ii) above can be applied to a securitisation exposure other than a liquidity facility, the bank shall assign to the relevant exposure amount a risk weight of 1250 per cent, or such imputed percentage that will effectively result in an amount equivalent to a deduction against capital and reserve funds.
            (E) in all relevant cases in respect of which a bank applies the standard formula approach, a floor risk weight of-
                (i) 7 per cent shall apply in respect of a securitisation exposure;
                (ii) 20 per cent shall apply in respect of a resecuritisation exposure;
            (F) the bank shall treat any exposures that overlap in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (6)(h) above;
            (G) the bank shall treat any exposure relating to a securitisation scheme that contains an early amortisation mechanism in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (p) below;
            (H) the bank shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (12) when the bank obtains any protection in respect of a securitisation exposure;
            (I) the maximum amount of capital to be maintained by a bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposures relating to a securitisation scheme shall be equal to the amount of capital that the bank would have been required to maintain in respect of the underlying credit exposures had the exposures not been securitised, which amount shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in subregulations (10), (11) and (12), read with the relevant provisions of subregulations (21) and (22), provided that the bank shall deduct from its common equity tier 1 capital and reserve funds the entire amount included in the bank's capital and reserve funds in respect of any gain-on-sale or credit- enhancing interest-only strips that arose from the securitisation transaction.

    (c) Categorisation of exposures (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 42)
    A bank that adopted the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk shall categorise its banking book exposures into one and apply the IRB approach in respect of all material asset categories specified below:
        (i) Corporate exposure (#Heading)
        When a bank is engaged in specialised lending activities the bank shall subdivide any corporate exposure resulting from such specialised lending activities into one of the categories specified below:
            (A) Project finance (#Heading)
            Normally project finance relates to the provision of funds to a special-purpose institution for the acquisition or construction of large and complex installations such as power plants, mines or chemical processing plants, the repayment of which funds is based solely or almost exclusively on the funds generated by the relevant project and the collateral value of the project's assets, that is, the borrower of the funds has no or little independent capacity to repay the obligations arising from the borrowed funds, and in respect of which specialised lending agreement the reporting bank has a substantial degree of control over the said asset and the income produced by that asset.
            (B) Object finance (#Heading)
            Normally object finance relates to the provision of funds to a special-purpose institution for the acquisition of physical assets such as ships or aircrafts, the repayment of which funds is based solely or almost exclusively on the cash flows generated by the relevant asset and which assets are usually pledged as security to the lending bank, that is, the borrower of the funds has no or little independent capacity to repay the obligations arising from the borrowed funds, and in respect of which specialised lending agreement the reporting bank has a substantial degree of control over the said asset and the income produced by that asset.
            (C) Commodity finance (#Heading)
            Normally commodity finance relates to the provision of funds in respect of structured short-term lending in order to finance, for example, inventories or receivables from exchange-traded commodities such as crude oil, metals or crops, the repayment of which funds is based solely or almost exclusively on the proceeds derived from the sale of the commodity, that is, the borrower of the funds has no or little independent capacity to repay the obligations arising from the borrowed funds and the exposure's rating reflects its self-liquidating nature.
            (D) Income-producing real estate (#Heading)
            Normally income-producing real estate relates to the provision of funds for real estate such as office buildings to let, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space and hotels, the repayment of which funds is based solely or almost exclusively on the cash flows generated by the asset, such as lease or rental payments, or the sale of the asset, that is, there is a strong positive correlation between the prospects for the repayment of the exposure and the prospects for the recovery in the event of default, with both events being materially dependent upon the cash flows generated by the relevant property.
            (E) High-volatility commercial real estate (#Heading)
            For the purposes of these Regulations, a bank shall classify any funding provided in respect of commercial real estate that exhibits higher loss rate volatility, that is, higher asset correlation, than other types of specialised lending as a high-volatility commercial real estate exposure, including-

                (ii) such exposures relating to commercial real estate as may be specified in writing by the Registrar.
        When the repayment of a debt obligation of a corporation, partnership or proprietorship is not solely or almost exclusively based on the cash flows envisaged in items (A) to (E) above and the bank is able to rate the credit quality of the obligor based on the obligor's broader ongoing operations and independent capacity to repay its debt obligations, the bank shall classify the said exposure as a corporate exposure instead of one of the subcategories envisaged in items (A) to (E) above.
        (ii) Sovereign exposure (#Heading)

                    In the case of-
                    (i) senior claims not secured by eligible collateral, a bank shall apply a ratio of 45 per cent;
                    (ii) subordinated claims, that is, a facility that is expressly subordinated to another facility, a bank shall apply a ratio of 75 per cent.
                $M$ is the effective maturity of the relevant exposure, which maturity shall be regarded as being equal to 2.5 years unless the exposure relates to a repurchase or resale transaction in which case an effective maturity equal to six months shall apply, provided that-
                    (i) the Registrar may require; or
                    (ii) on prior written application by the reporting bank and subject to such conditions as may be specified in writing, the Registrar may allow,
                    a bank to calculate the effective maturity of a particular exposure in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (13) (d)(ii)(B) below     
                $R$ is the relevant correlation, which correlation shall be calculated through the application of the formula specified below

                            (bb) any specific credit impairment raised or partial write-off made by the reporting bank in respect of the relevant exposure amounts.
                        (ii) In the case of off-balance-sheet items other than unsettled derivative contracts, the exposure at default shall be equal to the sum of committed but undrawn amounts multiplied by the relevant credit conversion factors specified in subregulation (6)(g), provided that-
                            (aa) in the case of any irrevocable undrawn commitment, note-issuance facility or revolving underwriting facility, instead of the  credit-conversion factors specified in subregulation (6)(g), the bank shall apply a credit-conversion factor of 75 per cent irrespective of the maturity of such commitments, note-issuance facilities or revolving underwriting facilities, unless the said exposures or a portion of the said exposures constitutes an uncommitted or revocable facility in which case the bank shall apply a_ credit-
                            conversion factor equal to zero per cent in respect of the said uncommitted or revocable exposure, provided that in the case of-

                (i) In the case of any drawn amounts, the exposure at default shall be equal to the sum of the drawn amounts after the effect of set-off in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in regulation 13 has been recognised, provided that the said exposure shall not be less than the sum of-
                    (aa) the amount by which the bank's capital requirement would be reduced when the exposure amounts are written off in full; and
                    (bb) any specific credit impairment raised or partial write-off made by the reporting bank in respect of the exposure amounts.
                (ii) In the case of off-balance-sheet items other than foreign exchange or interest rate commitments, the exposure at default shall be equal to the sum of any committed but undrawn amounts multiplied by the credit conversion factors estimated by the reporting bank, provided that-
                    (aa) when the relevant retail exposures have uncertain future drawdown, such as credit cards, the bank shall take into account its history and/or expectation of additional drawings prior to default;
                    (bb) when the bank's estimate of EAD does not incorporate credit conversion factors in respect of additional drawings on undrawn lines prior to default, the bank shall make appropriate adjustments to its estimates of LGD;
                    (cc) when the bank has securitised the drawn balances of retail facilities, the bank shall by way of credit-conversion factors continue to include its exposure in respect of the undrawn balances, that is, the seller's interest, based on the proportions of the sellers and investor's interests of the securitised drawn balances.
                (iii) In the case of foreign exchange or interest rate commitments, in accordance with the relevant provisions of subregulation (6) relating to the said commitments.

                $PD$ is the probability of default, and constitutes a ratio
                A bank shall apply a PD ratio equal to the higher of the one-year PD ratio associated with the relevant internal grade to which the pool of exposures is assigned, or 0.03 per cent.
                $LGD$ is the loss-given-default ratio as estimated by the bank
                $R$ is the correlation, which correlation shall be a constant number equal to 0.04
                $EAD$ is the exposure at default, which exposure shall be measured in accordance with the relevant directives relating to the measurement of EAD specified in item (A) above.

                $PD$ is the probability of default, and constitutes a ratio
                A bank shall apply a PD ratio equal to the higher of the one-year PD ratio associated with the relevant internal grade to which the pool of exposures is assigned, or 0.03 per cent.
                $LGD$ is the loss-given-default ratio as estimated by the bank
                $R$ is the correlation, which correlation shall be calculated through the application of the formula specified below
                    $R= 0.03 x (1 - \exp(-35 x PD)) / (1 - \exp(-35)) + 0.16 \times [1 - (1 - \exp(-35 x PD))/(1 - \exp(-35))] $
                $EAD$ is the exposure at default, which exposure shall be measured in accordance with the relevant directives relating to the measurement of EAD specified in item (A) above.

            (D) In the case of retail exposures that are in default-
                (i) the capital requirement (K) shall be equal to the higher amount of zero and the difference between the exposure's LGD and the bank's estimate of expected loss, provided that-
                    (aa) the LGD estimate in respect of retail exposures secured by residential property shall in no case be less than 10 per cent unless the said exposure is protected by a guarantee obtained from a sovereign;
                    (bb) the Registrar may amend the said minimum LGD ratio of 10 per cent subject to such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar;
                (ii) the bank shall assign to the relevant exposure a PD ratio equal to 100 per cent;
                (iii) the relevant risk-weighted exposure amount shall be calculated through the application of the formula 18 specified below.

        A bank shall calculate its risk-weighted assets in respect of equity exposures held in its banking book in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in regulation 31.
        (vi) Purchased receivables (#Heading)
            (A) A bank shall separately calculate its risk-weighted assets in respect of purchased retail receivables and purchased corporate receivables, provided that the bank shall in the calculation of its risk-weighted exposure in respect of a particular purchased receivable or pool of purchased receivables distinguish between-
                (i) the risk of default (#Heading)
                When purchased receivables unambiguously belong to one asset class, the bank shall calculate the risk of default relating to the said receivables in accordance with the risk- weight function and risk components applicable to that particular exposure type, provided that the bank shall comply with the relevant requirements in respect of the relevant risk-weight function. For example, when the receivables consist of-
                    (aa) revolving retail exposures but the bank is unable to comply with the requirements relating to qualifying revolving retail exposures, the bank shall apply the risk-weight function relating to other retail exposures;
                    (bb) hybrid pools containing a mixture of exposure types, that is, the bank is unable to separate the exposures by type, the bank shall apply the risk-weight function producing the highest capital requirement for the exposures included in the pool of purchased receivables.
                (ii) the risk of dilution (#Heading)
                In the case of purchased corporate receivables and purchased retail receivables, a bank shall calculate the risk weights relating to the risk of dilution, that is, the risk that a receivable amount may be reduced by way of cash or non-cash credit amounts being made against the receivable account, for example, as a result of the return of goods that were sold or disputes regarding the quality of a product, in accordance with the corporate risk-weight function specified in subparagraph (ii) above, provided that-
                    (aa) the bank shall estimate the one-year expected loss ratio for dilution risk, expressed as a percentage of the receivable amount, in respect of the pool as a whole or the individual receivables included in the pool on a stand-alone basis, that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse, support or guarantees from the seller or other parties;
                    (bb) the bank may use relevant external or internal data to estimate the said expected loss ratio;
                    (cc) the bank shall set the PD estimate equal to the estimated expected loss ratio and the LGD ratio equal to 100 per cent;
                    (dd) the bank shall apply such a maturity factor as may be specified in writing by the Registrar or, with the prior written approval of the Registrar and provided that the bank manages the risk of dilution in an appropriate manner, a one-year maturity factor;
                    (ee) when the risk of dilution is immaterial for the purchasing bank, the bank may apply for the approval of the Registrar not to calculate risk weights in respect of the risk of dilution.
            (B) Purchased retail receivables (#Heading)
            A bank shall calculate the risk estimates of PD and LGD, or expected loss, in respect of default risk relating to purchased retail receivables on a stand-alone basis, that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties, provided that-
                (i) the bank shall comply with the relevant minimum requirements relating to retail exposures specified in paragraphs (b)(v)(D), (b)(vi)(B), (b)(viii)(D), (b)(viii)(E) and (c)(iv) above;
                (ii) the bank may use external and internal reference data to estimate the PD ratio and LGD ratio relating to the relevant exposure;
                (iii) when the bank complies with the relevant minimum requirements in respect of retail exposure as envisaged in sub-item (i) above, the bank may apply the “top-down” approach envisaged in paragraph (b)(vi)(F) above in order to calculate the said estimates of PD and LGD, provided that the bank shall in addition to the said requirements in respect of retail exposure comply with the relevant requirements relating to the “top-down” approach, specified in paragraph (b)(vi)(F) above.
            (C) Purchased corporate receivables (#Heading)
                (i) A bank shall calculate the risk-weighted assets relating to default risk of individual obligors in respect of purchased corporate receivables in accordance with the formula and risk components specified in subparagraph (ii) above, which formula and risk components relate to corporate exposure, provided that-
                    (aa) when the bank is unable to decompose the expected loss ratio into its PD and LGD components, the bank-
                        (i) shall determine the risk weight in respect of the purchased corporate receivable from the corporate risk-weight function using a LGD ratio of 45 per cent provided that the exposures exclusively consist of senior claims in respect of corporate borrowers;
                        (ii) shall calculate the PD ratio by dividing the expected loss ratio by the LGD ratio of 45 per cent;
                        (iii) shall calculate the EAD amount as the outstanding amount minus the capital requirement relating to the risk of dilution, before the bank takes into consideration the effect of any risk mitigation instrument, provided that in the case of a revolving facility the EAD amount shall be equal to the purchased receivable amount plus 75 per cent of any undrawn purchased commitments minus the capital requirement relating to the risk of dilution;
                        (iv) shall in all cases other than the exposures already specified in this sub-item (aa), use a PD ratio equal to the expected loss ratio, a LGD ratio equal to 100 per cent and an EAD amount equal to the outstanding amount minus the capital requirement relating to the risk of dilution, before the bank takes into consideration the effect of any risk mitigation instrument;
                    (bb) when the bank is able to estimate the PD ratio in a reliable manner, the bank shall determine the risk weight in respect of the relevant exposure from the corporate risk weight function, based on the relevant requirements relating to LGD and M;
                (ii) Subject to the prior written approval of and such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar, a bank may apply the “top-down” approach envisaged in paragraph (b)(vi)(F) above in order to calculate the risk weight relating to default risk in respect of a pool of purchased corporate receivables, provided that-

                        (i) shall have a claim in respect of all proceeds from the pool of receivables or a relevant pro-rata interest in the proceeds, which claim shall exclude any first-loss or second-loss positions, that is, the cash flows arising from the purchased corporate receivables shall be the reporting bank's primary protection against default risk;
                        (ii) shall estimate the pool's one-year expected loss ratio for default risk, expressed as a percentage of the exposure amount, that is, the total EAD amount due to the bank by all obligors in the pool of purchased receivables;
                        (iii) shall estimate the expected loss ratio in respect of the purchased receivables on a stand-alone basis, that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties;
                        (iv) shall, based on the pool's estimated one-year expected loss ratio for default risk, calculate the risk weight for default risk in accordance with the risk-weight function for corporate exposures specified in subparagraph (ii) above;
                        (v) shall utilise relevant external and internal data to estimate the required PD ratios and LGD ratios;
                        (vi) shall follow the directives specified in sub-item (i)(aa) above when the bank is unable to decompose the expected loss ratio into its PD and LGD components;
                    (dd) the Registrar shall grant approval to apply the “top-down” approach only in exceptional cases when the calculation of the bank's risk-weighted exposure in respect of purchased corporate receivables in accordance with the requirements specified in subparagraph (ii) relating to corporate exposure is likely to place an undue burden on the reporting bank;

                    (aa) provide first loss protection in respect of the risk of default or dilution;
                    (bb) will be refunded to the seller,
                (ii) shall ignore any purchase price discounts that were granted in respect of purchased corporate or retail receivables, other than purchase price discounts envisaged in sub-item (i), when the bank calculates its risk-weighted exposure or credit impairments relating to expected loss provided that the said discounts shall constitute non refundable amounts, that is, the said discounts shall not be paid or repaid to the relevant seller of the receivable amounts.
        (vii) Cash and cash equivalent amounts (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 84)
        A bank shall risk weight all cash and cash equivalent amounts such as gold bullion at zero per cent.
        (viii) Securitisation or resecuritisation exposure (#Heading)
        A bank shall calculate its risk-weighted assets in respect of a securitisation scheme or resecuritisation exposure in accordance with the relevant requirement specified in paragraphs (e) to (p) below.
        (ix) Other exposures (#Heading)
        Unless specifically otherwise stated, a bank shall risk weight all exposures other than the exposures specified above at a risk weight of 100 per cent, which risk weight shall be deemed to represent the unexpected loss in respect of the relevant exposure.
    (e) Securitisation or resecuritisation exposure: rating-based approach (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 84)

        (i) the external rating or inferred rating of a securitisation or resecuritisation exposure;
        (ii) whether the external or inferred credit rating represents a long-term or short-term credit rating;
        (iii) the granularity of the underlying pool of assets or exposures;

    (f) Securitisation exposure: conditions relating to an inferred rating  (#Heading)
    A bank that applies the rating-based approach in respect of exposures that arise from a securitisation scheme shall assign an inferred rating to all unrated positions that rank more senior than an externally rated securitisation exposure, which externally rated securitisation exposure shall serve as the reference securitisation exposure, provided that-
        (i) the reference securitisation exposure shall in all respects be subordinated to the relevant unrated securitisation exposure;
        (ii) the bank shall take into account any relevant credit enhancement when the bank assesses the relative subordination of the unrated exposure in relation to the reference securitisation exposure. For example, when the reference securitisation exposure benefits from any third-party guarantee or other credit enhancement, which protection is not available to the unrated exposure, the bank shall not assign an inferred rating to the said unrated exposure;
        (iii) the maturity of the reference securitisation exposure shall be equal to or longer than the maturity of the relevant unrated exposure;
        (iv) on a continuous basis, the bank shall update any inferred rating in order to reflect any changes in the external rating of the reference securitisation exposure;
        (v) the external rating of the reference securitisation exposure shall comply with the requirements specified in subregulation (6) above.

    When a bank extends facilities such as liquidity facilities or credit-enhancement facilities to a special-purpose institution involved in an asset-backed commercial paper programme, the bank may apply its internal assessment of the credit quality of the said exposures in order to calculate the bank's required amount of capital and reserve funds, provided that-
        (i) the bank's internal assessment process shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in this paragraph (g) and in paragraph (h) below;
        (ii) the bank shall map its internal assessment of exposures extended to the asset-backed commercial paper programme to equivalent external ratings issued by an eligible external credit assessment institution, which rating equivalents shall be used by the bank to determine the appropriate risk weights relating to the relevant exposure in terms of the ratings-based approach specified in paragraph (e) above;
        (iii) based on the credit rating equivalent assigned by the bank to an eligible exposure, the bank shall assign the notional amount of the securitisation exposure extended to the asset-backed commercial paper programme to the appropriate risk weight specified in the rating-based approach in paragraph (e) above;
        (iv) when, in the opinion of the Registrar, the bank's internal assessment process does not comply with the relevant requirements specified in this paragraph (g), or such further conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar, the bank shall in the calculation of its required amount of capital and reserve funds relating to all eligible exposures extended to an asset-backed commercial paper programme apply-
            (A) the standard formula approach specified in paragraph (i) below; or
            (B) the approach specified by the Registrar, which approach shall be based on the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (b) (xii) (D) (iil) above, 
        for such time and on such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar.
    (h) Securitisation exposure: conditions relating to a bank's internal assessment process (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 88)
    For the calculation of a bank's minimum required amount of capital and reserve funds relating to unrated exposures such as liquidity facilities or credit-enhancement facilities, which facilities are extended by the bank to an asset-backed commercial paper programme, the bank may use its internal assessments relating to the said exposures, provided that-
        (i) the relevant asset-backed commercial paper programme-
            (A) shall be externally rated, which rated exposures relating to the asset-backed commercial paper programme shall be subject to the ratings-based approach specified in paragraph (e) above;
            (B) shall have in place-
                (i) appropriate credit and investment guidelines, that is, underwriting standards;
                (ii) a duly established collection process, which collection process, amongst other things-
                    (aa) shall consider the operational capability and credit quality of the relevant servicer;
                    (bb) shall prevent the co-mingling of funds;
                (iii) sufficiently robust procedures in order to consider all sources of potential risk, including credit and dilution risk, when estimating the aggregate amount of potential loss relating to the assets/exposures to be purchased by the special-purpose institution, that is, when the credit enhancement provided by the seller is based only on credit-related losses, a separate reserve shall be established to cover any material risk of dilution;
                (iv) structural features such as wind-down triggers for every pool of purchased assets/exposures in order to reduce the risk relating to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying pool of assets/exposures;
        (ii) the bank's internal assessment-
            (A) of the credit quality of the said securitisation exposure shall be based on criteria similar to the criteria used by an eligible external credit assessment institution for the particular exposure type and shall be equivalent to at least investment grade when initially assigned by the bank;
            (B) shall correspond to the external credit ratings used by eligible external credit assessment institutions;
        (iii) in order to ensure that a credit-enhancement facility is sufficient, the bank shall review historical information in respect of the assets/exposures transferred to the special-purpose institution, which review shall be based on information for a sufficient number of years and shall include matters such as-
            (A) losses;
            (B) delinquencies;
            (C) dilution; and
            (D) the turnover rate of receivables;
        (iv) the bank- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 89)
            (A) shall conduct-
                (i) a credit analysis of the risk profile of the seller of the relevant assets/exposures, which analysis shall include matters such as-
                    (aa) past and expected future financial performance;
                    (bb) current market position;
                    (cc) expected future competitiveness;
                    (dd) leverage;
                    (ee) cash flow;
                    (ff) interest coverage;
                    (gg) debt rating;
                (ii) a review of the seller's-
                    (aa) underwriting standards;
                    (bb) servicing capabilities;
                    (cc) collection processes;
            (B) shall evaluate the characteristics of the underlying pool of assets/exposures, which evaluation shall include matters such as-
                (i) the weighted average credit score;
                (ii) any concentrations in respect of a particular obligor, industry or geographical region;
                (iii) the granularity of the underlying pool of assets/exposures;
            (C) shall apply the relevant internal assessment in the bank's internal risk management processes, including the bank's management information and economic capital systems;
            (D) shall, subject to the provisions of item (E) below, demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Registrar-
                (i) that the criteria, standards and methodology used in the bank's internal assessment process correspond with the relevant criteria, standards and methodology applied by the eligible external credit assessment institution that rated the relevant asset-backed commercial paper programme, provided that when the methodology or stress factors applied by the said eligible external credit assessment institution change, which change adversely affects the external rating of the programme's commercial paper, the bank shall consider the potential impact of the revised rating methodology or stress factors in order to determine whether the bank's internal assessments assigned to eligible exposures extended to the asset-backed commercial paper programme exposures remain relevant;
                (ii)  which internal assessment category corresponds to which external rating category used by the relevant eligible external credit assessment institution;
            (E) shall not apply the rating methodology used by an external credit assessment institution to derive an internal assessment unless the rating process and rating criteria applied by the relevant external credit assessment institution are publicly available, provided that, subject to the prior written approval of and such conditions as may be specified in writing by the Registrar, the Registrar may allow a bank in exceptional cases when the rating process and rating criteria applied by the relevant external credit assessment institution are not publicly available, to derive an internal assessment in respect of a particular exposure extended by the bank to an asset-backed commercial paper programme;
            (F) shall regularly-
                (i) review its internal assessment process;
                (ii) assess the validity of its internal assessments,
            which review or assessment may be conducted by the bank's internal or external auditors, an eligible external credit assessment institution or the bank's risk management function, provided that when the review or assessment is conducted by the bank's internal auditors or risk management function, the said auditors/function shall be independent from the business line involved in the relevant asset-backed commercial paper programme and underlying customer relationships;
            (G) shall track the performance of its internal assessments over time in order to-
                (i) evaluate the performance of the bank's assigned internal assessments; and
                (ii) make timely adjustments to the said internal assessments;
        (v) the bank's internal assessment process- (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 91)
            (A) shall provide a meaningful differentiation and distribution of risk;
            (B) shall include stress factors relating to credit enhancement, which stress factors shall be at least as conservative as the publicly available rating criteria applied by the major eligible external credit assessment institutions that rate the particular asset/exposure type being purchased into the particular asset-backed commercial paper programme;
        (vi) when the commercial paper issued in terms of an asset-backed commercial paper programme is rated by two or more eligible external credit assessment institutions, the stress factors of which institutions require different levels of credit enhancement to achieve the same external rating, the bank shall apply the stress factor that requires the most conservative or highest level of credit protection. For example, when one eligible external credit assessment institution requires enhancement of 2,5 to 3,5 times historical losses for an asset type to be assigned a single A rating and another eligible external credit assessment institution requires 2 to 3 times historical losses, the bank shall use the higher range of stress factors in order to determine the appropriate level of credit enhancement;
        (vii) in respect of each relevant asset-backed commercial paper programme, the programme administrator shall ensure that-
            (A) the said asset-backed commercial paper programme is subject to prudent underwriting standards;
            (B) an appropriate structure relating to each potential purchase transaction is in place, which structure-
                (i) shall be used to determine whether or not the particular assets/ exposures should be purchased by the special-purpose institution;
                (ii) shall deal comprehensively with-
                    (aa) the type of asset that may be purchased by the special-purpose institution;
                    (bb) the type and monetary value of exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit-enhancement facilities;
                    (cc) the manner in which losses shall be absorbed;
                    (dd) matters relating to the legal and economic isolation of the assets/exposures transferred to the special-purpose institution;
        (viii) the underwriting policy of the asset-backed commercial paper programme shall contain minimum eligibility criteria, which criteria-
            (A) shall prevent the purchase of assets/exposures that are significantly past due or defaulted;
            (B) shall limit-
                (i) excess concentration to an individual obligor;
                (ii) excess concentration to a geographic area;
                (iii) the tenor of the assets to be purchased.
    (i) Securitisation exposure: risk-weighted exposure calculated in terms of the standard formula approach (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 93)
    A bank-
        (i) shall calculate its risk-weighted exposure in respect of any unrated securitisation exposure, which exposure is not subject to the internal assessment approach specified in paragraph (g) above, through the application of the formula 18 and the risk components specified below.
            #Formula 18
            $RWE = K \times 12,5$
            where:
            $RWE$ is the relevant risk-weighted exposure amount
            $K$ is the capital requirement relating to the securitisation exposure, which capital requirement shall be based on the formulae and the risk components specified in paragraphs (j) to (0) below.
            #Formula 18 - end
        (ii) may reduce its calculated risk-weighted exposure when the bank obtains eligible risk mitigation instruments against the said securitisation exposure, provided that-
            (A) the bank shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (12);
            (B) the bank shall only proportionally reduce the bank's capital requirement when the eligible credit risk mitigation instrument covers only first losses or losses on a proportional basis;
            (C) in the case of proportional cover, the bank shall assume that the eligible credit risk mitigation instrument firstly covers the most senior portion of the securitisation exposure, that is, the most junior portion of the securitisation exposure shall be regarded as unprotected or unsecured.
                #Example 3
                For example, in the case of an originator-
                (i) that obtains proportional cover in the form of cash collateral
                Assume that-
                    (aa) the originating bank purchased a securitisation exposure of R10 000;
                    (bb) the purchased exposure is protected by a credit-enhancement facility in excess of $K_{IRB}$;
                    (cc) no external or inferred rating in respect of the exposure is available;
                    (dd) the capital requirement in respect of the purchased securitisation exposure, calculated in terms of the standard formula specified in paragraph (j) below, is equal to R160, that is, the risk-weighted exposure amount is equal to R2 000 (R160 multiplied by 12,5);
                    (ee) the originating bank obtained collateral in the form of cash equal to R8 000, which cash collateral is denominated in Rand;
                    (ff) the percentage relating to the minimum capital requirement is equal to 8 per cent.
                The capital requirement relating to the securitisation exposure is determined by multiplying the capital requirement calculated in terms of the standard formula, that is, R160, by the ratio of the adjusted exposure amount to the original exposure amount as illustrated below.
                    Step 1
                        $E^* = \max {0, [E x (1 + He) - C x (1 - He - Hfx)]}$
                        $E^* = \max {0, [10 000 x (1 + 0) -8 000 x (1 - 0 - 0)]}$
                        $= R2 000$
                        where:
                        $E^*$ is the relevant adjusted exposure amount after risk mitigation (R2 000)
                        $E$ is the relevant current exposure amount (R10 000)
                        $He$ is the relevant haircut in respect of the exposure
                        $C$ is the relevant current value of the collateral (R8 000)
                        $Hc$ is the relevant haircut in respect of the collateral (0)
                        $Hfx$ is the relevant haircut in respect of a mismatch between the collateral and the exposure (0)
                    Step 2
                        Capital requirement = $(E^* / E)$ x capital requirement determined in terms of the standard formula
                        That is R2 000 / R10 000 x R160 = R32.
                (ii) that obtains proportional cover in the form of a guarantee
                Assume that the information is the same as in the previous example except that the bank obtained a guarantee from a bank that qualifies for a risk weight of 10 per cent instead of cash collateral.
                The protected portion of the securitisation exposure, that is, R8 000 will be assigned the risk weight of the guarantor, that is, 10 per cent.
                The capital requirement in respect of the protected portion is equal to R8 000 x 10% x 8% = R64.
                The capital requirement in respect of the unprotected portion, that is, R2000, is equal to the share of the unprotected portion to the exposure amount, that is, R2 000 / R10 000 = 20%. Therefore the capital requirement is equal to R160 x 20% = R32.
                The total capital requirement in respect of the protected and unprotected portions is equal to R64 (protected portion) + R32 (unprotected portion) = R96.
                (iii) that obtains protection in respect of the most senior portion of an exposure
                Assume that-
                    (aa) a bank that acts as an originator securitises a pool of loans equal to R100 000;
                    (bb) the $K_{IRB}$ ratio relating to the underlying pool is equal to 5 per cent, that is, a capital requirement of R5 000;
                    (cc) the first loss facility is equal to R2 000;
                    (dd) the originating bank retained only the second most junior tranche, which tranche is unrated and equal to R4 500;
                    (ee) the risk weight relating to the retained tranche, calculated in terms of the standard formula, is equal to 820 per cent;
                    The position may be summarised as follows:
                        a. Portion of exposure above $K_{IRB}$: R1 500
                        b. Remaining portion of exposure: R3 000
                        c. First loss position: R2 000
                        Unrated retained tranche = a + b = R4 500
                        $K_{IRB}$ = b+c = R5 000
                    The bank's capital requirement without any protection is equal to the sum of the capital requirements for the portion of the tranche above Krg and the portion of the tranche below Kirg, that is, R1500 x 820% x 8%= R984 plus the portion of the tranche below Ks that constitutes an impairment equal to R3 000 x 1 250% x 8% = R3000 equals a total capital requirement for the unrated tranche of R3 984.
                    When the originating bank obtains cash collateral denominated in Rand equal to R2 500, the collateral will be deemed firstly to cover the most senior portion of the tranche, that is, the portion above $K_{IRB}$, which portion is fully protected and equal to R1 500.
                        Step 1
                            $E^* = \max {0, [E x (1 + He) - C x (1 - He - Hfx)]} = max {0, [1500 - 1 500]} = RO$
                            where:
                            $E^*$ is the relevant exposure value after risk mitigation (RO)
                            $E$ is the relevant current value of the exposure (R1 500)
                            $C$ is the relevant current value of the collateral (R1 500)
                            $He$ is the relevant haircut in respect of the exposure
                            $Hc$ and $Hfx$ is the relevant haircut in respect of the collateral
                        Step 2
                            Capital requirement = (E* / E) x capital requirement determined in terms of the standard formula.
                            That is 0 x R984 = RO
                            The portion of the tranche below $K_{IRB}$ is equal to R3 000, which portion is protected by the remaining cash collateral equal to R1 000.
                            The R1 000 cash collateral is allocated to the most senior portion of the R3 000 tranche.
                        Step 1
                            $E^* = \max {0, [8 000 x (1 + 0) - 1 000 \times (1 - 0 - 0)]} = R2 000$
                        Step 2
                            Capital requirement = (E* / E) x capital requirement determined in terms of the standard formula
                            That is R2 000/R3 000 x R3 000 = R2 000
                            The total capital requirement in respect of the unrated tranche is equal to RO + R2 000 = R2 000
                            When the bank obtains an eligible unsecured guarantee of R2 500 instead of cash collateral the capital requirement is determined as specified below.
                            The most senior portion of the tranche is equal to R1 500, which portion is protected by the guarantee, that is, the portion is fully protected and is assigned a risk weight equivalent to an unsecured exposure to the guarantor, which risk weight is assumed to be equal to 20 per cent.
                            The capital requirement in respect of the most senior protected portion is R1 500 x 20% x 8%= R24.
                            The remaining portion of the tranche is equal to R3 000, the most senior part of which portion is protected by the remaining part of the guarantee, which remaining part is equal to R1 000.
                            Accordingly, the protected portion of the remaining portion is equal to R1 000 and the unprotected portion is equal to R2 000.
                            The risk weight of the guarantor is assigned to the protected portion, the capital requirement of which portion is equal to R1 000 x 20% x 8%= R16.
                            The capital requirement for the unprotected portion is equal to R2 000 x 1 250% x 8%= R2 000.
                            The total capital requirement in respect of the unrated tranche is equal to R24 (protected portion above KIRB) plus R16 (protected portion below KIRB) plus R2000 (unprotected portion below KIRB) is equal to R2 040.

        (i) is a ratio, which ratio shall be calculated as-
            (A) the capital requirement relating to the relevant underlying exposures in the pool, that is, the amount of capital that the bank would have been required to maintain if the bank directly held or was directly exposed to the underlying assets/exposures included in the pool, which amount of required capital-
                (i) shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant IRB approach envisaged in subregulation (10);

            (B)  when the risk weight relating to the relevant securitisation exposure is equal to 1 250 per cent, the bank shall risk weight the relevant securitisation exposure in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (q) read with the relevant provisions of subregulation (6)(j), or deduct the relevant securitisation exposure amount from its common equity tier 1 capital and reserve funds;
            (C) when the bank raised a specific credit impairment or received a non-refundable purchase price discount in respect of an exposure included in the pool, the bank shall in the calculation of the amounts specified in paragraph (k)(i) above apply the gross amount relating to the exposure, that is, the amount before the relevant specific credit impairment and/or non-refundable purchase price discount is taken into consideration, provided that the bank may in the case of an asset that defaulted reduce the amount that constitutes an impairment against the capital and reserve funds of the bank, which impairment relates to the said securitisation exposure, with the said credit impairment raised or non-refundable purchase price discount.
    (l) Securitisation exposure: matters relating to the extent of credit enhancement, denoted by L (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 102)

        #Formula 20
        $N = \frac{\left( \sum_{i}EAD_i\right)^2}{\sum_i EAD_i^2}$
        where:
        $EAD_i$ is the exposure-at-default amount associated with the $i$-th instrument in the pool of exposures, provided that-
            (i) the bank shall consolidate multiple exposures to the same obligor, that is, the aggregate amount shall be treated as a single instrument;
            (ii) in the case of re-securitisation, that is, the securitisation of securitised exposures, the formula shall apply to the number of securitisation exposures in the securitised pool and not the number of underlying exposures in the original pools;
            (iii) when-
                (A) the share of the portfolio associated with the largest exposure, $C_1$ is available, the bank may compute $N$ as $1/C_1$;
                (B) the share of the portfolio associated with the largest exposure, $C_1$, is no more than 0,03, that is, 3 per cent of the underlying pool, the bank may deem the LGD ratio to be equal to 0,50, that is, 50 per cent, instead of the exposure-weighted average LGD ratio calculated in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (0) below, and calculate the effective number of exposures, that is, $N$, in accordance with the formula specified below:
                $N=\left( C_1C_m + \frac{C_m-C_1}{m-1} \max(1-mC_1, 0) \right)^{-1} $
                where:
                $C_m$  is the share of the pool that corresponds to the sum of the largest “m” exposures. For example, a 15 per cent share corresponds to a value of 0.15.
                $m$ is the threshold determined by the bank
                (C) $C_1$  is available and does not exceed 3 per cent of the underlying pool, the bank may deem $N$ to be equal to $1/C_1$ and the LGD ratio to be equal to 50 per cent, instead of calculating the respective variables in accordance with the relevant requirements respectively specified in paragraphs (n) and (0).

            (i) in the case of re-securitisation, that is, the securitisation of a securitisation exposure, the LGD ratio relating to the underlying securitised exposures shall be deemed to be equal to 100 per cent;
            (ii) when the risk of default and the risk of dilution relating to purchased receivables are treated in an aggregate manner, that is, a single reserve or over-collateralisation was established to absorb losses relating to the risk of default and the risk of dilution within the securitisation scheme, the calculation of the relevant LGD ratio shall be based on the weighted average LGD ratio relating to default risk and a 100 per cent LGD ratio relating to dilution risk, that is, the resultant weights shall be the standalone IRB capital requirement relating to default risk and dilution risk.

                (iii) Leases other than leases that expose the bank to residual risk
                When a bank obtains collateral in the form of a lease agreement in respect of instruments/ assets that qualify as eligible collateral in terms of the foundation IRB approach, such a lease agreement shall be recognised as eligible collateral, provided that the bank shall in addition to the relevant minimum requirements relating to the relevant type of instrument/asset ensure that-
                    (aa) the lessor has in place a robust risk-management process, which risk management process shall comprehensively address matters relating to-

                    (cc) the difference between the rate of depreciation of a physical asset and the rate of amortisation of the lease payments is not material, causing the risk mitigation effect of the leased asset to be overstated;
                (iv) Leases that expose the bank to residual risk
                When a bank obtains collateral in the form of a lease agreement in respect of instruments/ assets that qualify as eligible collateral in terms of the foundation IRB approach, which lease agreement exposes the bank to residual risk, that is, the bank is exposed to a potential loss due to, for example, a decline in the fair value of the equipment below the residual estimate at the inception of the lease agreement, the bank shall risk weight the relevant exposure in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in subparagraph (iii)(C) below.
                (v) Physical collateral other than the types of collateral specified above, excluding any physical assets acquired by the reporting bank as a result of default by an obligor in respect of an underlying exposure, specified in writing by the Registrar, provided that-

                    (dd) the relevant loan agreement shall include a detailed description of the said collateral and detailed specifications in respect of the manner and frequency of revaluation;
                    (ee) the bank shall have in place robust policies, processes and procedures relating to physical collateral, which policies, processes and procedures-
                        (i) shall in the case of inventories such as raw materials or work-in-progress, and equipment, ensure that the bank conducts regular physical inspections of the said collateral;
                        (ii) shall be subject to regular and appropriate independent review;
                    (ff) the bank-
                        (i) shall duly document the types of physical collateral and loan-to-value or lending-to-value ratios acceptable to the bank;

                (i) shall calculate an adjusted exposure (E*) in accordance with the relevant formulae specified in subregulation (9)(b) above, provided that the bank shall comply with the relevant requirements that apply to the said formulae;
                (ii) shall in the case of transactions other than repurchase and resale agreements subject to master netting agreements, calculate an effective loss-given-default ratio applicable to the collateralised transaction through the application of the formula 22 specified below.

                    where:
                    LGD* is the effective loss-given-default ratio
                    LGD shall be equal to 45 per cent, that is, the LGD ratio that applies to a senior unsecured exposure
                    E is the relevant current value of the exposure
                    #Formula 22 - end
                (iii) shall in the case of repurchase and resale agreements subject to master netting agreements calculate an adjusted exposure (E*) in accordance with the relevant directives specified in subregulation (9)(b)(ix), which adjusted exposure shall be deemed to represent EAD, that is, the
                bank shall not recognise the impact of collateral obtained in respect of the said transactions through an adjustment to LGD.
                Similar to a bank that adopted the comprehensive approach in respect of collateral obtained in terms of the standardised approach, a bank that complies with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (9)(b)(xv) relating to repurchase and resale agreements, may apply a haircut of zero per cent in respect of the said agreements.
            (B) collateral in respect of the bank's corporate exposure, which collateral is recognised as eligible collateral in terms of the foundation IRB approach but not in terms of the standardised approach, the bank shall, subject to the provisions of item (C) below, in the case of a senior corporate exposure, divide the senior exposure into-
                (i) a fully collateralised portion
                The bank shall subsequently calculate the ratio of the current value of the collateral received to the current value of the exposure through the application of the formula 23 specified below.
                    #Formula 23
                    Ratio = C/E
                    where:
                    C is the relevant current value of the collateral received
                    E is the relevant current value of the exposure
                    #Formula 23 - end
                When the said calculated ratio is below the threshold levels denoted C*, specified in table 15 below, the LGD ratio shall be 45 per cent, that is, the LGD ratio shall be similar to the LGD ratio in respect of an unsecured corporate exposure. When the said calculated ratio exceeds a higher threshold denoted C**, that is, the bank has an over-collateralised position, the bank shall, based on relevant type of collateral, assign to the relevant exposure the LGD ratios specified in table 15 below:
                    #Table 15
                    ||Minimum LGD|Required minimum collateralisation level of the exposure (C*)|Required level of over-collateralisation for full LGD recognition (C*)|
                    ------|------|------|------|
                    Receivables|35%|0%|125%|
                    Commercial real estate and/or residential real estate| 35%|30%|140%|
                    Other collateral|40%|30%|140%|
                    #Table 15 - end
                (ii)  an uncollateralised portion
                The portion of the exposure not covered in terms of sub-item (i) above shall be regarded as unsecured and the bank shall assign to the said portion a LGD ratio equal to 45 per cent.
            (C) eligible collateral in the form of a lease agreement, which lease agreement exposes the bank to residual risk, the bank shall risk weight-
                (i) the discounted lease payments based on the financial strength, that is, the PD ratio, of the lessee, and the LGD ratio specified by the Registrar;
                (ii) the residual value at 100 per cent.

    (c) Pools of collateral (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 116)
    When a bank obtained both eligible financial collateral and other eligible collateral, that is, collateral that is regarded as eligible collateral in terms of the foundation IRB approach but not in terms of the standardised approach, in respect of the bank's exposure to corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks, the bank-
        (i) shall subdivide the adjusted value of the exposure, after the bank has applied the relevant haircut relating to eligible financial collateral, into the relevant portions covered by only one type of collateral, that is, the bank shall divide the exposure into a portion covered by-
            (A) eligible financial collateral;
            (B) receivables;
            (C) collateral consisting of commercial real estate or residential real estate;
            (D) other collateral;
        and, when relevant, an unsecured portion.
        When the ratio of the sum of the values of commercial real estate or residential real estate, and other collateral, to the reduced exposure, after the effect of eligible financial collateral and collateral consisting of receivables has been recognised, is below the relevant threshold level specified in paragraph (b)(iii)(B)(i) above, the bank shall assign to the relevant exposure an LGD ratio relating to an unsecured exposure, that is, 45 per cent.
        (ii) shall separately calculate the risk-weighted exposure in respect of each fully secured portion of exposure in order to calculate the exposure's effective LGD and aggregated risk-weighted amount.

            (B) shall, except in the case of retail exposures and purchased retail receivables, use the LGD ratios specified in writing by the Registrar in respect of the bank's various exposures;
            (C) shall not in the calculation of the bank's risk-weighted exposure reflect the effect of double default otherwise than in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (g) below, that is, the adjusted risk weight relating to a particular exposure shall not be less than a comparable direct exposure to the relevant guarantor unless the bank calculates the said adjusted risk weight in accordance with the relevant requirements specified in paragraph (g) below,
        provided that whenever a guarantee obtained in respect of an exposure results in a higher capital requirement for the reporting bank than before the recognition of such guarantee, the reporting bank may ignore the effect of the said guarantee.
        (ii) Eligible guarantors (#Heading)
        In addition to the eligible guarantors specified in the standardised approach in subregulation (7)(c), a bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach for the recognition of risk mitigation relating to guarantees obtained in respect of its exposures to corporate institutions, sovereigns, banks or purchased receivables may also recognise the effect of a guarantee obtained from a guarantor internally rated by the bank, provided that-
            (A) the said guarantee shall comply with the relevant minimum requirements specified in subregulation (7)(c) above;
            (B) for purposes of calculating the minimum required amount of capital and reserve funds of a branch in terms of the provisions of the Banks Act, 1990, read with these Regulations, no guarantee received from the parent foreign institution or any other branch of the parent foreign institution in respect of an exposure incurred by the branch in the Republic shall be regarded as an eligible guarantee.
        (iii) Risk weighting (#Heading)
        When a bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's risk-weighted credit exposure obtains-
            (A) protection from an eligible guarantor in respect of the bank's credit exposure to a corporate institution, sovereign or bank the bank-
                (i) shall divide the relevant exposure into a protected portion and an unprotected portion;

                    (bb) the PD ratio relating to the relevant guarantor, or a higher PD ratio relating to a risk grade between the underlying obligor and the relevant guarantor when the bank deems a complete substitution approach inappropriate,
                provided that, based on its seniority or any collateralisation of a guaranteed commitment, the bank may replace the LGD ratio of the underlying transaction with the relevant LGD ratio relating to the said guaranteed position;
                (iii) shall in respect of the unprotected portion, apply the risk weight relating to the underlying obligor;
                (iv) shall in the case of-

            (B) protection in the form of a guarantee in respect of a retail exposure or pool of retail exposures, the bank may reflect the risk reducing effect of the guarantee through an adjustment to the relevant PD ratio or LGD ratio, provided that the bank-
                (i) shall comply with the relevant minimum requirements specified in subregulation (14)(c)(i) below;
                (ii) shall apply the relevant adjustment to the PD ratio or LGD ratio in a consistent manner in respect of a given type of guarantee, and over time.
            (C) protection in the form of a guarantee in respect of purchased receivables, the bank shall in the case of a guarantee-
                (i) that covers both default risk and dilution risk, substitute the risk weight relating to default risk and dilution risk for the risk weight of the guarantor;
                (ii) that covers only default risk or dilution risk, but not both, substitute the relevant risk weight relating to default risk or dilution risk for the risk weight of the guarantor, and add the relevant capital requirement for the other component;
                (iii) that covers only a portion of the default risk and/or dilution risk, substitute the risk weight in respect of the protected exposure in accordance with the relevant directives specified above, and add the relevant risk weights relating to the unprotected exposure.
            (D) protection against dilution risk in respect of purchased receivables, the bank may apply the double default approach specified in paragraph (g) below in order to calculate the required risk-weighted asset amount for dilution risk, provided that-

        (i) Minimum requirements (#Heading)
        As a minimum, a bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach for the recognition of risk mitigation relating to credit protection obtained in the form of a credit-derivative instrument-
            (A) shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (9)(d);
            (B) shall, except in the case of retail exposures and purchased retail receivables, use the LGD ratios in respect of its various exposures as specified in writing by the Registrar;

        provided that whenever credit protection obtained in respect of an exposure results in a higher capital requirement for the reporting bank than before the recognition of such credit protection, the reporting bank may ignore the effect of the said credit protection.
        (ii) Eligible protection providers (#Heading)
        In addition to the eligible protection providers specified in the standardised approach in subregulation (9)(d)(iii), a bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach for the recognition of risk mitigation relating to credit-derivative instruments obtained in respect of corporate institutions, sovereigns or banks may also recognise the effect of protection obtained from a protection provider that is internally rated, provided that the said protection shall comply with the relevant minimum requirements specified in subregulation (9) (d) (xi) above.

                provided that, based on its seniority or any collateralisation of a protected exposure, the bank may replace the LGD ratio of the underlying transaction with the relevant LGD ratio relating to the said protected position;
                (iii) shall in respect of the unprotected portion, apply the risk weight relating to the underlying obligor;

    A bank that adopted the foundation IRB approach for the recognition of risk mitigation shall comply with the relevant requirements specified in subregulation (9)(e) in respect of any maturity mismatches between the bank's exposure to credit risk and the risk mitigation obtained in respect of the said credit exposure.
    (g) Double default (#Heading) (02-Regulations-part-2.pdf; pg 122)
        (i) In respect of each eligible exposure, a bank that obtained the prior written approval of the Registrar to adopt the foundation IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk may apply either the substitution approach envisaged in paragraphs (d) and (e) above or double default approach specified in this paragraph (g), provided that a bank that wishes to apply the double default approach-
            (A) shall continuously comply with the relevant minimum requirements specified in this paragraph (g);
            (B) in respect of the said eligible exposure shall calculate the relevant risk-weighted exposure amount and any related required amount of capital and reserve funds in accordance with the formulae and requirements specified in subparagraph (iv) below;

            (D) may apply the said double default approach to any eligible exposure, irrespective whether the exposure is held in the bank's banking book or trading book.
        (ii) Eligible exposure (#Heading)
        A bank that obtained the prior written approval of the Registrar to adopt the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk may apply the double default approach only when-
            (A) the relevant underlying obligation or exposure constitutes-
                (i) a corporate exposure as envisaged in subregulation (11)(c)(i), provided that no specialised lending exposure subject to and mapped into the risk grades specified in subregulation (11)(d)(iii)(C) shall be eligible for treatment in terms of the double default approach;
                (ii) a claim on a public-sector entity, provided that no sovereign exposure shall be eligible for treatment in terms of the double default approach;
                (iii) a loan extended to a small business and categorised as a retail exposure as envisaged in  subregulation (11)(c)(iv)(A) (iii),

                (iv) an nth-to-default basket product, in which case the protection obtained shall be eligible in terms of the double default approach only when the reporting bank also obtained eligible (n-1)th default protection or (n-1) of the assets within the basket have already defaulted,
                that is, under no circumstances shall protection relating to-
                    (aa) multiple name credit derivative instruments, other than nth-to-default basket products;
                    (bb) multiple name guarantees;

                be eligible for the double default approach.

        (iii) Specific minimum requirements relating to the double default approach (#Heading)
        A bank that obtained the prior written approval of the Registrar to adopt the IRB approach for the measurement of the bank's exposure to credit risk, which bank wishes to apply the double default approach envisaged in this paragraph (g), shall continuously comply with the requirements specified in this subparagraph (iii).
            (A) The PD ratio, LGD ratio, internal rating, external rating or risk weight associated with the relevant exposure prior to the application of the double default approach shall not already factor in any aspect relating to the relevant credit protection obtained, that is, credit protection shall under no circumstances be double counted.
            (B) The protection provider-
                (i) shall be a financial entity or institution, which financial entity or institution may be-
                    (aa) a bank, but under no circumstances any public-sector entity or multilateral development bank that is treated in a manner similar to a bank in terms of these Regulations;
                    (bb) an investment company or institution;
                    (cc) an insurance or re-insurance company or entity the business of which includes the provision of credit protection on a regular basis;
                    (dd) any non-sovereign credit export agency, that is, the credit protection shall not in any manner benefit from any sovereign guarantee or counter-guarantee;
                (ii) shall be regulated in a manner similar to a bank, that is, the protection provider shall be subject to minimum required capital or solvency requirements, appropriate supervisory oversight and transparency, that is, minimum requirements relating to market discipline, or the protection provider shall have an external rating from an eligible external credit assessment institution of no less than investment grade;
                (iii) at the time the credit protection for the relevant exposure was originally obtained, or for any period of time thereafter, had an internal rating with a PD ratio equivalent to or lower than the PD ratio associated with an external credit assessment or rating of A-; and
                (iv) shall have an internal rating with a PD ratio equivalent to or lower than the PD ratio associated with an external investment grade rating or assessment.
            (C) The credit protection obtained shall comply with the relevant minimum operational requirements envisaged in paragraphs (d) and (e) above.
            (D) The reporting bank shall have the legal right and expect to receive payment from the relevant protection provider without first having to pursue the relevant obligor for payment, that is, the reporting bank shall take all reasonable steps in order to ensure that the protection provider is willing and able to promptly pay when a credit event occurs.
            (E) Once a credit event occurs, the purchased credit protection shall make provision for immediate payment in respect of all credit losses incurred by the reporting bank in respect of the hedged portion of the relevant exposure.
            (F) When the payout structure of the relevant credit protection obtained makes provision for physical settlement, the reporting bank shall have legal certainty regarding the deliverability of the relevant loan, instrument or contingent liability and when the bank intends to deliver an obligation other than the underlying exposure, the bank shall ensure that the deliverable obligation is sufficiently liquid in order for the bank to purchase the said obligation for delivery in accordance with the relevant requirements of the contract.
            (G) The terms and conditions of the relevant credit protection shall be duly documented and legally confirmed in writing by the credit protection provider and the reporting bank.
            (H) In the case of protection obtained against dilution risk, the seller of the purchased receivables shall not be a member of the same group as the protection provider.
            (I) The reporting bank shall have in place a sufficiently robust process to monitor and control situations in which the performance of the protection provider and the protected obligor or exposure are dependent upon common factors, that is, the reporting bank shall have in place a sufficiently robust process to ensure that the double default approach is not applied to any exposure in respect of which excessive correlation exists between the creditworthiness of the protection provider and the obligor of the relevant underlying exposure.
            For example, situations in which a protection provider guarantees the debt of a supplier of goods or services when the supplier derives a high proportion of its income or revenue from the protection provider shall not be eligible for the double default approach.
        (iv) Matters specifically related to risk-weighted exposure and the required amount of capital and reserve funds (#Heading)
        In respect of any hedged or protected exposure subject to the double default approach, the reporting bank shall calculate its risk-weighted exposure and related required amount of capital and reserve funds through the application of the formulae 24 specified below, which formulae take into account the relevant risk components related to the said protected exposure.
            #Formula 24
            $RWA_{DD} = K_{DD} \times 12.5 \times EAD_g$,
            where:
            $RWA_{DD}$ is the risk-weighted asset amount relating to the protected exposure subject to the double default approach
            $EAD_{g}$ is the relevant exposure at default amount, that is, the protected or hedged exposure amount
            and
            $K_{DD} = K_0 \times (0.15+160 \times PD_g)$
            where:
            $K_{DD}$ is the capital requirement in respect of the hedged or protected exposure subject to the double default approach
            $PD_g$ is the PD ratio of the protection provider or guarantor, which PD ratio shall be subject to a minimum of 0,03 per cent
            $K_0$ shall be calculated through the application of the relevant formula and in a manner similar to unprotected corporate exposure as envisaged in subregulation (11)(d)(ii), even when the underlying obligation or eligible exposure is a loan extended to a small business qualifying as a retail exposure, provided that in respect of the relevant hedged exposure the risk components specified in the formula below, which risk components relate to the LGD ratio and the maturity adjustment, shall be applied instead of the said risk components specified in the said formula in subregulation (11)(d)(ii).
            $$ K_0 = LGD_g \cdot \left[ N\left( \frac{G(PD_0 + \sqrt{\rho_{os}} \cdot G(0.999))}{\sqrt{1-\rho_{os}}} \right) \right] \cdot \frac{1+(M-2.5) \cdot b}{1-1.5 \cdot b}$$
            where:
            $PD_0$ is the PD ratio of the obligor, which PD ratio shall be subject to a minimum of 0,03 per cent
            $\rho_{os}$ is a correlation factor, which correlation factor shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant formula and requirements for the calculation of "R", specified in subregulation (11)(d)(ii), with PD being equal to $PD_{0}$
            $LGD_{g}$ is the LGD ratio associated with the protected or hedged exposure, that is, the LGD ratio relating to a direct exposure to the relevant protection provider or guarantor, provided that when evidence indicates that in the event both the guarantor and the obligor default during the life of the protected exposure the amount recovered depends upon the financial condition of the obligor, the bank shall apply the LGD ratio relating to an unprotected and direct exposure to the said obligor
